## Project Overview

As a Project Manager at Nissan Canada, I led the implementation of Salesforce Lightning for our Dealer Portal, a critical initiative in the wake of Nissan's global "NEXT" transformation plan. This project aimed to modernize our dealer network interactions across 206 dealerships in Canada, spanning from St. John's, Newfoundland to Victoria, British Columbia. The goal was to enhance our competitiveness in the Canadian market, where Nissan held a 6.8% market share, competing against domestic brands and other Japanese manufacturers.

## Industry Context

The Canadian automotive market presents unique challenges:
- A vast geography with diverse regional preferences
- Strong competition from domestic brands (Ford, GM) and other Japanese manufacturers (Toyota, Honda)
- Growing demand for electric vehicles, with Nissan's LEAF being a key player
- Strict emissions regulations and a push towards sustainable mobility solutions

## Project Objectives

1. Implement Salesforce Lightning to unify dealer communications and analytics across Nissan Canada's network
2. Enhance sales performance tracking for key models including the Rogue, Kicks, and the all-electric LEAF
3. Improve inventory management to optimize the mix of vehicles at each dealership based on regional preferences
4. Streamline warranty claims processing and parts ordering systems
5. Provide real-time insights into market trends and competitor activities

## Methodology Highlights

### Stakeholder Coordination and Requirements Management

- Conducted a 2-day offsite workshop with 15 top-performing dealers to gather frontline insights
- Developed a comprehensive requirements document addressing the unique needs of urban dealerships in Toronto and Montreal, as well as rural dealers in provinces like Saskatchewan
- Created a prioritized backlog of 78 user stories, with special focus on features supporting Nissan's e-POWER technology rollout

### Cross-Team Collaboration and Vendor Management

- Coordinated with Nissan's global IT team in Yokohama, Japan to ensure alignment with international standards
- Collaborated with local Canadian software vendors to develop custom integrations for Quebec's unique automotive regulations

### Project Execution

- Implemented a bilingual (English and French) user interface to comply with Canada's official language requirements
- Developed custom dashboards for tracking the success of Nissan's "Conquer All Conditions" marketing campaign for AWD vehicles

## Technical Solution

Key features of the Salesforce Lightning implementation included:

- Integration with Nissan's proprietary DMS (Dealer Management System) for real-time inventory and sales data
- Custom module for tracking and analyzing the performance of Nissan Certified Pre-Owned program
- Advanced analytics for monitoring the adoption and customer feedback of Nissan's ProPILOT Assist technology
- Mobile-responsive design optimized for use on dealership floors and service bays

## Impact and Results

The successful implementation led to significant improvements:

- Increased overall dealer satisfaction score from 7.2 to 8.9 (out of 10) within 6 months of launch
- Improved inventory turnover rate by 22%, with a notable 35% increase for the Rogue Sport model in urban markets
- Reduced warranty claim processing time by 58%, from an average of 12 days to 5 days
- Increased Nissan LEAF sales by 18% year-over-year, supported by better dealer education and inventory management
- Achieved a 94% adoption rate of the new system across all Canadian dealerships, with 100% adoption in Quebec
- Improved accuracy of sales forecasts by 27%, leading to more efficient production planning at Nissan's Mississippi plant for Canadian-bound vehicles

## Unique Challenges and Solutions

1. **Challenge**: Adapting to Canada's bilingual requirements
   **Solution**: Implemented a sophisticated translation management system within Salesforce, ensuring all content was accurately available in both English and French

2. **Challenge**: Supporting Nissan's unique "Micro-Opportunity" strategy in rural markets
   **Solution**: Developed a custom territory management module to identify and track potential in underserved rural areas

3. **Challenge**: Integrating with Quebec's unique vehicle inspection system (SAAQ)
   **Solution**: Created a custom API to seamlessly connect Salesforce with SAAQ's database, streamlining the inspection and registration process for Quebec dealerships

## Conclusion

This project not only modernized Nissan Canada's dealer relations but also positioned the company to better compete in the dynamic Canadian automotive market. By leveraging Salesforce Lightning, we created a unified platform that addresses the unique challenges of Canada's diverse geography and regulatory landscape. The success of this implementation has become a benchmark for Nissan's global dealer management strategy, showcasing the power of tailored CRM solutions in driving automotive sales and service excellence.
