#### I was hired for my digital analytics expertise at FedEx, where I’ve had the opportunity to work extensively with the Adobe Marketing Suite, particularly Adobe Analytics and Audience Manager. My journey at FedEx has been marked by a deep dive into the world of web analytics across multiple regions, where I’ve spearheaded initiatives that not only provided insights but also drove actionable outcomes.

## Key Responsibilities

### 1. **Global Web Analytics Reporting**
   - **Regions Covered**: Europe, Asia, and Latin America
   - **Tools Used**: Adobe Analytics, Audience Manager
   - **Deliverables**: Weekly market-specific analytics reports, quarterly deep dives

   My primary responsibility was to deliver insightful web analytics reports to regional teams across Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Each week, I compiled and analyzed data from Adobe Analytics to produce detailed reports tailored to the specific needs of each market. These reports covered key performance indicators (KPIs), user behavior trends, and conversion metrics, providing a clear picture of how each region's website was performing.

### 2. **Quarterly Deep Dives on Customer Behavior**
   - **Focus Areas**: Testing & personalization, customer journey enhancements, revenue opportunities, tag management support

   Every quarter, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of customer behavior on FedEx’s regional websites. These deep dives involved a thorough examination of user interactions, identifying pain points, and uncovering opportunities for optimization. Based on the findings, I provided actionable recommendations on testing and personalization strategies, customer journey enhancements, and revenue growth opportunities. Additionally, I supported the implementation of new features by ensuring proper tag management and data collection.

### 3. **Leadership & Team Management**
   - **Team Size**: 2 direct reports
   - **Role**: Lead the team while transitioning to new roles within FedEx

   After two years of managing the entire web analytics function, I transitioned into a leadership role where I oversaw a team of two analytics professionals. My focus was on mentoring them to ensure continuity of high-quality reporting and insights, while I took on additional responsibilities in other areas of the business.
