# Leveraging Analytics for Voice of Customer Insights at FedEx

## Project Overview

As a Web and Digital Analytics Specialist at FedEx, I led a crucial initiative to analyze customer call center data, aiming to identify recurring topics for FAQ development and guide creation. This project not only enhanced our customer support resources but also provided valuable insights for our marketing team to improve content strategy.

## My Role and Contributions

In this project, I served as the bridge between our business needs and technical implementation. My primary responsibilities included:

1. Defining project objectives and scope
2. Liaising between marketing, sales, and technical teams
3. Interpreting data insights and translating them into actionable recommendations
4. Ensuring alignment of technical solutions with business goals

I collaborated closely with a Python engineer who handled the coding and implementation of the NLP model.

## Objectives

1. Identify common customer pain points and frequently asked questions
2. Develop a data-driven approach to FAQ and guide creation
3. Improve marketing content strategy by highlighting key areas of customer interest

## Methodology

- Identified [Y] potential areas for improvement in our existing FAQs and guides
- Created a comprehensive customer journey map highlighting [Z] key touchpoints for content optimization

### 2. Data Collection and Requirements Gathering

Working closely with our IT department and the Python engineer, I:

- Defined the data requirements for the analysis, including call transcripts, web analytics data, and CRM information
- Ensured compliance with data privacy regulations in data extraction and handling
- Collaborated on data cleaning and preprocessing strategies to ensure data quality

### 3. NLP Model Development and Insight Generation

While the Python engineer focused on the technical implementation, my role involved:

- Providing business context and marketing insights to guide the model development
- Collaborating on feature selection and topic modeling to ensure relevance to our business objectives
- Interpreting model outputs and translating them into actionable insights for our marketing and support teams

### 4. Insight Analysis and Recommendation Development

Leveraging my expertise in digital analytics and marketing, I:

- Analyzed the NLP model outputs in conjunction with web analytics data to identify content gaps and opportunities
- Developed a prioritized list of recommendations for new FAQ topics and guide creation
- Created a content strategy framework to address the identified customer pain points

## Key Findings

2. Package Tracking
   - Context: Real-time updates, accuracy of estimated delivery times
3. International Shipping Regulations
   - Context: Customs documentation, prohibited items
4. Pricing Inquiries
   - Context: Bulk shipping discounts, dimensional weight pricing

## Impact and Results

The insights gained from this analysis led to several significant improvements:

- Developed [A] new FAQ articles addressing the top [B] customer concerns
- Created [C] comprehensive guides on complex topics like international shipping
- Improved website navigation, resulting in a [D]% decrease in related customer service calls
- Enhanced marketing email campaigns with targeted content, increasing click-through rates by [E]%
- Reduced average handling time for customer support calls by [F]%, translating to an estimated cost saving of $[G] annually

## Conclusion
