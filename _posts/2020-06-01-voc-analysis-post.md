## Project Overview

As a Web and Digital Analytics Specialist at FedEx, I led a crucial initiative to analyze customer call center data along with web journies they took before clicking "call", aiming to identify recurring topics for FAQ development and guide creation. This project not only enhanced our customer support resources but also provided valuable insights for our marketing team to improve content strategy.

## My Role and Contributions

In this project, I served as the bridge between our business needs and technical implementation. My primary responsibilities included:

1. Defining project objectives and scope
2. Liaising between marketing, sales, and technical teams
3. Interpreting data insights and translating them into actionable recommendations
4. Ensuring alignment of technical solutions with business goals

I collaborated closely with a Python engineer who handled the coding and implementation of the NLP model.

## Objectives

1. Identify common customer pain points and frequently asked questions
2. Develop a data-driven approach to FAQ and guide creation
3. Improve marketing content strategy by highlighting key areas of customer interest

## Methodology

### 1. Stakeholder Collaboration and Business Analysis

I initiated the project by:

- Conducting in-depth interviews with our sales and marketing teams to gather their perspectives on customer pain points
- Analyzing existing web analytics data to identify high-traffic support pages and common search queries
- Mapping customer journey touchpoints to identify potential gaps in our support content

Key outcomes:
- Compiled a list of [X] assumed pain points
- Identified [Y] potential areas for improvement in our existing FAQs and guides
- Created a comprehensive customer journey map highlighting [Z] key touchpoints for content optimization

### 2. Data Collection and Requirements Gathering

Working closely with our IT department and the Python engineer, I:

- Defined the data requirements for the analysis, including call transcripts, web analytics data, and CRM information
- Ensured compliance with data privacy regulations in data extraction and handling
- Collaborated on data cleaning and preprocessing strategies to ensure data quality

### 3. NLP Model Development and Insight Generation

While the Python engineer focused on the technical implementation, my role involved:

- Providing business context and marketing insights to guide the model development
- Collaborating on feature selection and topic modeling to ensure relevance to our business objectives
- Interpreting model outputs and translating them into actionable insights for our marketing and support teams

### 4. Insight Analysis and Recommendation Development

Leveraging my expertise in digital analytics and marketing, I:

- Analyzed the NLP model outputs in conjunction with web analytics data to identify content gaps and opportunities
- Developed a prioritized list of recommendations for new FAQ topics and guide creation
- Created a content strategy framework to address the identified customer pain points

   - Asia-specific: 
     - Varying import/export regulations across Asian countries
     - Documentation requirements for shipments to and from China
     - Restrictions on electronic goods shipments in certain Southeast Asian countries

4. Pricing Inquiries

   - Asia-specific: 
     - Fluctuating fuel surcharges impacting overall shipping costs
     - Pricing disparities between different Asian countries
     - Special economic zone shipping rates in China

5. Last-Mile Delivery Issues

     - Availability of customer support in local languages
     - Multilingual tracking and documentation services

## Impact and Results

The insights gained from this analysis led to several significant improvements:

- Customer support created more than 20 new FAQ articles addressing these top customer concerns, with linked articles realted to customs and regulations specifically tailored to Asian markets
- Created comprehensive guides for each geo on topics like international shipping and adding consulting links to FedEx partners across those regions and links for our high value customers who have free support.
- Improved website navigation and introduced region-specific landing pages, resulting in a 40% decrease in related customer service calls from Asian customers
- Reduced average handling time for customer support calls, and an improvement specifically for calls from Asian customers

## Conclusion
